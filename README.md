## How to play
Open TeamSpeak 3 Client
Launch the game
_After leaving the lobby, you'll be automatically assigned to a side_

`Join` a squad and select a role:

  - Rifleman
  - Medic
  - Anti Tank (`AT`)
  - Machine Gunner (`MG`)
  - Marksman

If you have commanding skills, then try `creating` a squad and become its Squad Leader (`SL`). As such you can:

  - Place `waypoints` to guide your squad members.
  - Place Rally Points(`RP`): another squad member in the proximity required.
  - Deploy Forward Operation Bases (`FOBs`): two other team mates in the proximity required.
  - Coordinate with other `SL` over the radio (see [Communicate](#communicate))

### Select a spawn point
- Main base
- Non-contestable area
- Rally Point (RP): deployed by the Squad Leader and available only for people in the squad
  its life span is 2 minutes. Once expired, cannot be deployed for 5 minutes.
- Forward Operation Base (FOB): deployed by any Squad Leader and available for the whole team.

### <a name="communicate"></a>Communicate:
  - TS `push-to-talk` to speak on direct
  - `CAPSLOCK` to speak to your squad
  - SL only: `CTRL + CAPSLOCK` to speak on the command channel with other SL

No radio configuration needed.
Remember: the enemy can always hear you if they are close enough

### Play the objective
  - __Stick__ to your squad
  - Only your __current last flag__ can be taken by the enemy, defend it!
  - Only the next enemy or neutral flag to your last can be taken, take it!
  - Place marks on the map to let your team know of enemy locations:
    * Open the map
    * `Right click` and select your marker from the list.
  - Destroy enemy `FOBs` you find by tactical guarding it within a 30m radius for 2 minutes (minimum 2 players). Enemy `FOB` will be blocked. If you leave the area without destroying it, it will remain blocked for 2 minutes.
  - Rearm at `RP` and `FOB` by looking at it and pressing `F`. Only once every 5 minutes without respawn.

### Healing
Access healing options using the __scroll wheel__
Select `Field dressing` and hold `right mouse button` to bandage yourself. Apply several times if required (might need a medic to fully recover)

Before dying, a player becomes `incapacitated`, with a bleeding timeout of 2 minutes. To revive an incap player:

  1. Apply __1 single bandage__ by selecting `Field dressing` and holding `left mouse button`
  2. Inject `Adrenaline`
  3. Apply `Field dressing`. Will require a medic to fully recover.
  4. If player is shacking, inject `Morphine`

Medics heal others __faster__ and are the only ones to make wounded players to __fully recover__ when applying `Field dressing`. If you are a medic, _stay alive!_,your squad needs you.
